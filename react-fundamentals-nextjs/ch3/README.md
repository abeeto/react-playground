## notes
so as we can see it takes a lot of code to do simple things if we were to just use JS. 

This is becuase we are starting everything from scratch and everything is 'imperative' programming: the idea that we have to define each and every step to be able to construct the webpage.

React helps speed this process up becuase it is fundementally a declarative library that can build UI much faster. It's like placing an order for a burger at a fast food instead of reconstructing one yourself at home.

So in short, to avoid spending a lot of time and writing lots of code to manipulate and create the DOM structure and each every UI element, we can use React to speed things up.
