# react-playground

My personal little playground, where I will experiment with React and React frameworks (next.js).

The goal is to learn:
- web dev principles
- key concepts of react: states, hooks, context, promises, async/sync, client/server components, types
- learn TypeScript and how it differs from traditional JS.
- learn testing: unit, E2E, integration and maybe even API testing??
- setting up formatters
